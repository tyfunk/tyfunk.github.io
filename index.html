          <p>During this assignment, I was presented with a screenshot of a website and was asked to recreate it from scratch. This was done using advanced HTML and CSS techniques.</p></div>

          <h2><a href="http://tyfunk.github.io/news-site/" target="_blank">Typical News Site</a></h2>
          <p>An average news site was made using the basic guide of most news web pages and the design that is common to them. Similarities between this and other news sites can be seen and used to develop more complex websites.</p></div>
